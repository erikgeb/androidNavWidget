# Android Navigation custom widget demo

This is a simple demo app to show how a custom navigation widget may be easily made with android navigation. It uses a `ConstraintLayout` to build an interface with 3 navigation buttons on the right side of the screen. In the main activity, thanks to `addOnDestinationChangedListener` we get a correct behavior of the buttons colouring even when using the device back button.

This demo was made for a presentation at the meetup DMCA #33 (Développement Mobile Côte-d'Azur).
